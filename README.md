# Radio-Signals-from-Outer-Space-Classifier
- I'm going to use 2D Spectograms from Deep Space Radio Signals collected by the SETI *(Search for Extraterristrial Intelligence)* Institute. SETI uses the  Allen Telescope to  scan the star systems of known *ExoPlanets* at various radio frequencies, in order,  to detect faint but consistent radio signals (narrow band waves) from these systems.

  - By treating the 2D Spectograms as images I'm going to build and train a Neural Network that classifies each radio signal into 1 of 4 categories:
  
    - Squiggle
    - Narrow Band 
    - Noise
    - Narrow Band DRD
