# Radio-Signals-from-Outer-Space-Classifier
I'm going to use 2D Spectograms from Deep Space Radio Signals collected by the SETI (Search for Extraterristrial Intelligence) Institute. By treating the 2D Spectograms as images I'm going to build and train a Neural Network that classifies each radio signal into 1 of 4 categories.
